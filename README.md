### 1. INTRODUCTION
A website with an arcade design with games in Machine Learning and Python.
 
### 2. PACKAGES

##### 2.1. Numpy:
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
It contains among other things:
•	a powerful N-dimensional array object
•	sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
•	tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
•	useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

##### 2.2. Pandas:
Pandas is an open-source, BSD-licensed library providing high performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. The Pandas library is well suited for data manipulation and analysis using python. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

##### 2.3. Seaborn:
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
 
##### 2.4. Matplotlib:
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, the jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.
 
##### 2.5. SciKitlearn:
Scikit-learn provides machine learning libraries for python. Some of the features of Scikit-learn includes:
•	Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis
•	Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts
•	Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib

##### 2.6. Pygame:
Pygame is a Python wrapper module for the SDL multimedia library. It contains python functions and classes that will allow the programmer to use SDL’s support for playing CD-ROMs, audio and video output, keyboard, mouse, and joystick input.

##### 2.7. Django:
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so the programmer can focus on writing their app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It's free and open source. 

##### 2.8. Keras:
Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.

##### 2.9. OpenCV:
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license.

### 4. CONCLUSION 

* The idea behind this project was to inculcate the basic pillars of data science namely, data analysis, Machine learning, and python programming to create a website that can serve as a single user gaming interface.
* The website was divided into three modules.
* In the Hangman game, the program gives a random word from a list of words and the gamer predicts the word. A quirky user interface helps the game to be more enjoyable. The game is made purely in python, including the user interface. The gaming module “pygame” is used here to create the game. 
* The Rock paper scissors game enables the user to play the game with real-time hand gestures. The computer generates a random gesture to play. The hand gestures made by the user are segregated in three categories: Rock, paper, and scissors based on which the winner is predicted. We used Keras to train a model on hand gestures into classes of rock, paper, and scissors. The model was saved as an ‘h5’ file. Using this, we could predict the hand gestures of users. The hand gestures were captured and used for playing the game using the video support libraries in OpenCV.
* Exploratory data analysis is used to find the trends of the gaming world based on past data (1980 to 2015). Tickers such as genre, publisher, Global players, rating, Critic scores, and user scores help to find trends like: Popularity of genres, ratings based on genres, games released along the years, players across different platforms and nations, Sales of different genres according to the platforms, global sales vs. number of games released in different years can be seen. This can help gamers to choose the next best game according to their taste and the companies to cater to the needs of the gaming community.
